## Project Name: Aviakompaniya_yoʻlovchilarining_qoniqishini_bashorat_qilish

### Description:
This project focuses on predicting airline passengers' satisfaction levels based on various factors. The dataset includes customer feedback and demographic details, and the model employs data science techniques to provide predictions that can guide improvements in service quality.

### Contents:
- **Aviakompaniya_yoʻlovchilarining_qoniqishini_bashorat_qilish.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation.
- **README.txt**: A guide to understand and use this project.

### Requirements:
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (see below)

### Libraries:
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- (Other libraries used in the notebook, if applicable)

### How to Use:
1. **Setup the Environment**:
   - Install Python and Jupyter Notebook.
   - Install required libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - If additional libraries are used, install them as well.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Aviakompaniya_yoʻlovchilarining_qoniqishini_bashorat_qilish.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform EDA, train the machine learning model, and evaluate results.

3. **Input Data**:
   - Ensure the dataset (if applicable) is available in the same directory or update the file paths in the notebook accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The notebook generates insights from the data, visualizations, and predictive models for passengers' satisfaction.

### Notes:
- If you encounter any errors, check the compatibility of library versions.
- Modify hyperparameters and model configurations as needed to improve performance.
